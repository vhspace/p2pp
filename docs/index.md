# Welcome to the P2PP documentation


!!! info

    This is a forked project from [Tom Van Eede - P2PP](https://github.com/tomvandeneede/p2pp/)


P2PP is a PrusaSlicer Post processing script that has been originally developed for the Palette 2 to offer seamless integration into the PrusaSlicer Gcode generation workflow, hence the maybe somewhat weird name P2PP - P(alette)2 P(ost)P(rocessor).  
Other Palette devices, such as the Palette 3 (Pro) are also compatible.  
P2PP is installed on the same PC where PrusaSlicer is running. It is a separate program that PrusaSlicer will execute at the very end of its processing cycle during the gcode export.
